        My name is Ismail Sulaiman, I'm from Hebron\Dura, and I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia. I studied computer system engineering, and I work as an engineer at Tucows. I would like to keep learning, and I'm lucky to start this journey with you. Well,
        I like playing and watching sports, and I was a pro footballer a few years ago.
